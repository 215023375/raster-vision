Why Raster Vision?

Why do we need yet another deep learning library?
-------------------------------------------------

The current ecosystem of deep learning libraries is diverse and great - however they usually don't work well
out of the box with large imagery sets, and especially not geospatial imagery (satellite, aerial and drone imagery). For example, in traditional object detection, each image is a small PNG file and contains a few objects. In contrast, when working with satellite and aerial imagery, each image is a set of very large GeoTIFF files and contains hundreds of objects that are sparsely distributed. In addition, annotations and predictions are represented in geospatial coordinates using GeoJSON files.
