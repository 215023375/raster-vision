Viewing Tensorboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Backends that utilize TensorFlow will start up an instance of TensorBoard while training.
To view Tensorboard, go to ``https://<domain>:6006/``. If you're running locally, then ``<domain>`` should
be ``localhost``, and if you are running on remotely (for example AWS), <public_dns> is the public
DNS of the machine running the training command.
